**Project Author:** Mohamed | **Date Completed:** December 12, 2025

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive 360-degree analysis of financial performance, sales trends, and customer behavior using the **AdventureWorks** dataset. The entire end-to-end BI solution—from ETL to final visualization—was executed exclusively within Microsoft Excel.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Financial Health Audit:** Identify core KPIs and assess year-over-year profitability.
2. **Geographic & Product Deep-Dive:** Pinpoint the specific regions and SKUs driving the bottom line.
3. **Behavioral Analysis:** Uncover actionable customer segments to optimize retention.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used
* **Power Query (M):** Advanced data cleaning, transformation, and merging of disparate sources.
* **Power Pivot:** Creation of a relational data model (Star Schema) to handle large datasets.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Development of complex measures including **YoY Growth**, **AOV**, and **Profit Margins**.
* **Excel Dashboards:** Interactive UI with slicers and dynamic charts for executive reporting.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

### 1. Financial Performance & Recovery
* **The "2008 Comeback":** After a critical **25% revenue dip** in 2007, the business achieved a massive **206% YoY growth** in 2008, totaling **$307M** in revenue.
* **Profitability:** Maintained a healthy **41.1% overall profit margin**, driven largely by premium bike lines.
* **Efficiency:** A high **$486 Average Order Value (AOV)** indicates a successful premium market positioning.

### 2. Geographic & Product Drivers
* **Market Concentration:** The US and Australia contribute over **60% of total revenue**, identifying them as the primary "Engine" of the business.
* **Premium Dominance:** The *Mountain-200* and *Road-150* series maintain consistent **63% profit margins**, representing the most cost-efficient product segments.

### 3. Customer Loyalty & Demographics
* **Loyalty Pillars:** The Top 20 buyers placed **23 to 29 orders each**, signaling an untapped opportunity for a formal VIP program.
* **Revenue Correlation:** Data shows a strong correlation between **smaller family sizes** and higher total spend, suggesting a specific target for marketing spend.

## 🚀 Actionable Recommendations
1. **Diversify Geographic Risk:** While the US/Australia are strong, increasing investment in Canada/Germany will protect the business from regional economic shifts.
2. **SKU Optimization:** Phase out low-margin apparel items (like racing socks) that drag down the overall margin, or bundle them with high-margin bikes.
3. **Tiered Loyalty Launch:** Implement a "Platinum" tier for customers with 20+ orders to ensure long-term retention of high-value players.
4. **Targeted Campaigns:** Focus Q1 marketing budgets on smaller family segments to capitalize on their higher spending power.
